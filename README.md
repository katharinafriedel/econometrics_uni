- OLS and probit regression
- Hypothesis testing

- Confidence intervals and probability calculations
- Data visualization (box plots, fitted values)

**Tools used:** Python, pandas, numpy, skipy.stats, matplotlib.pyplot, statsmodels, 

*The dataset used in this project was provided for academic purposes and cannot be shared publicly*

This project reflects my current level of Python proficiency and understanding of applied econometrics. I'm continuously working to expand these skills and explore their application in finance and markets.
