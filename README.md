# Econometrics Take-Home Exam

This project was completed as part of my university coursework. It demonstrates basic econometric and Python skills including:

- OLS and probit regression
- Hypothesis testing
- Descriptive statistics (mean, std, skewness, etc.)
- Confidence intervals and probability calculations
- Data visualization (box plots, fitted values)

**Tools used:** Python, pandas, numpy, scipy.stats, matplotlib.pyplot, statsmodels

The dataset relates to the U.S. labor market during the Great Recession (2008-2009). It tracks changes in the unemployment rate, which rose from 5.0% in April 2008 to 10.0% by October 2009. The data enables analysis of how different demographic groups were affected differently in terms of job losses during this period.

*The dataset used in this project was provided for academic purposes and cannot be shared publicly*

This project reflects my current level of Python proficiency and understanding of applied econometrics. I'm continuously working to expand these skills and explore their application in finance and markets.
